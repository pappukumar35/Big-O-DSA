## ⚡ 1️⃣ Big O Notation — The Foundation

> 🧠 **Big O** tells how your algorithm’s runtime grows as input size increases.  

| Complexity | Name | Example |
|-------------|------|----------|
| 🟩 `O(1)` | Constant | Access array element |
| 🟦 `O(log n)` | Logarithmic | Binary Search |
| 🟨 `O(n)` | Linear | Traverse array |
| 🟧 `O(n log n)` | Linearithmic | Merge Sort |
| 🟥 `O(n²)` | Quadratic | Bubble Sort |
| 🔺 `O(2ⁿ)` | Exponential | Recursive Fibonacci |
| 🔻 `O(n!)` | Factorial | Traveling Salesman Problem |

🎯 **Quick Insight:**  
- `O(1)` → Fastest 💨  
- `O(n!)` → Slowest 🐢

## 🧮 4️⃣ Recursion & Master Theorem
📘 **Master Theorem Formula:**




Where:  
- `a` = number of subproblems  
- `n/b` = size of each subproblem  
- `f(n)` = cost outside recursive calls  

| Case | Condition | Complexity |
|------|------------|-------------|
| Case 1 | f(n) < n^(log_b a) | O(n^(log_b a)) |
| Case 2 | f(n) = n^(log_b a) | O(n^(log_b a) log n) |
| Case 3 | f(n) > n^(log_b a) | O(f(n)) |

✨ Example:  
`T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n)` → **O(n log n)**
